# Moe Counter Lite
Moe Counter Lite is recoded version of Moe-Counter with Improvments.<br>
It can handle averge 12,550 requests per seconds under 10-90ms response time(depends machine spec)<br>
I run Performance-Test for 30seconds and count reached 376,000, averge responce time is 20ms.<br>
It is 10x Faster than original Moe-Counter *This result is based on running the load test tool with the same specifications and settings.<br>

# How to fix "Mixed Content" error?
It's browser side error occurred for load HTTP content from HTTPS page.
To Fix this, you can use proxy server (nginx for example) and apply SSL Ceritification or Use Cloudflare's Proxy to get SSL Ceritification.<br>
If someone knows way to support SSL in node.js's http server let me know :D

# Only ï¼’ theme?
Sadly Yes. but You can add theme easly.
open themes.json and add this
```
{
            "name": "your-theme-title",
            "letters":{
                "0":"assets/your-theme-dir/0.gif",
                "1":"assets/your-theme-dir/1.gif",
                "2":"assets/your-theme-dir/2.gif",
                "3":"assets/your-theme-dir/3.gif",
                "4":"assets/your-theme-dir/4.gif",
