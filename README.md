# Moe Counter Lite
Moe Counter Lite is recoded version of Moe-Counter with Improvments.<br>
It can handle averge 12,550 requests per seconds under 10-90ms response time(depends machine spec)<br>
I run Performance-Test for 30seconds and count reached 376,000, averge responce time is 20ms.<br>
It is 10x Faster than original Moe-Counter *This result is based on running the load test tool with the same specifications and settings.<br>
